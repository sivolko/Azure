## Azure Networking

Azure Networking is a category of services in Microsoft Azure that provides fully managed and scalable networking and connectivity options like making a connection between your on-premises data center and the cloud. With networking services in Azure, you can also build secure virtual network infrastructure, manage your applicationâ€™s network traffic, and protect your applications against DDoS attacks. Networking resources in Azure can also be used to enable secure remote access to internal resources within your organizations and globally route your network connectivity with monitoring and security features.

The networking services in Azure provide various networking capabilities that can be used together or separately. Select any of the following key capabilities to learn more about them:

* [**Connectivity services**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/fundamentals/networking-overview#connect): Connect Azure resources and on-premises resources using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - Virtual Network (VNet), Virtual WAN, ExpressRoute, VPN Gateway, Virtual network NAT Gateway, Azure DNS, Peering service, Azure Virtual Network Manager, Route Server, and Azure Bastion.
* [**Application protection services**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/fundamentals/networking-overview#protect): Protect your applications using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - Load Balancer, Private Link, DDoS protection, Firewall, Network Security Groups, Web Application Firewall, and Virtual Network Endpoints.
* [**Application delivery services**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/fundamentals/networking-overview#deliver): Deliver applications in the Azure network using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - Content Delivery Network (CDN), Azure Front Door Service, Traffic Manager, Application Gateway, Internet Analyzer, and Load Balancer.
* [**Network monitoring**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/fundamentals/networking-overview#monitor): Monitor your network resources using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - Network Watcher, ExpressRoute Monitor, Azure Monitor, or VNet Terminal Access Point (TAP).

## Virtual network <a href="#vnet" id="vnet"></a>

[Azure Virtual Network (VNet)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. You can use VNets to:

* **Communicate between Azure resources**: You can deploy virtual machines, and several other types of Azure resources to a virtual network, such as Azure App Service Environments, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. To view a complete list of Azure resources that you can deploy into a virtual network, see [Virtual network service integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services).
* **Communicate between each other**: You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other, using virtual network peering or Azure Virtual Network Manager. The virtual networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions. For more information, see [Virtual network peering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) and [Azure Virtual Network Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network-manager/overview).
* **Communicate to the internet**: All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use [Public IP addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-public-ip-address) or public [Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) to manage your outbound connections.
* **Communicate with on-premises networks**: You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using [VPN Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) or [ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).

## Azure Virtual Network Manager <a href="#avnm" id="avnm"></a>

Azure Virtual Network Manager is a management service that enables you to group, configure, deploy, and manage virtual networks globally across subscriptions. With Virtual Network Manager, you can define network groups to identify and logically segment your virtual networks. Then you can determine the connectivity and security configurations you want and apply them across all the selected virtual networks in network groups at once.

## ExpressRoute

ExpressRoute enables you to extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider. This connection is private. Traffic doesn't go over the internet. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365.

## Azure DNS

## [Azure DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/) provides DNS hosting and resolution using the Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Azure DNS consists of three services:

* [Azure Public DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview) is a hosting service for DNS domains. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.
* [Azure Private DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-overview) is a DNS service for your virtual networks. Azure Private DNS manages and resolves domain names in the virtual network without the need to configure a custom DNS solution.
* [Azure DNS Private Resolver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview) is a service that enables you to query Azure DNS private zones from an on-premises environment and vice versa without deploying VM based DNS servers.

Using Azure DNS, you can host and resolve public domains, manage DNS resolution in your virtual networks, and enable name resolution between Azure and your on-premises resources.

## Azure Bastion

Azure Bastion is a service that you can deploy to let you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal, or via the native SSH or RDP client already installed on your local computer. The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that you deploy inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.

## Virtual network NAT Gateway <a href="#nat" id="nat"></a>

Virtual Network NAT(network address translation) simplifies outbound-only Internet connectivity for virtual networks. When configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses your specified static public IP addresses. Outbound connectivity is possible without load balancer or public IP addresses directly attached to virtual machines.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Route Server

Azure Route Server simplifies dynamic routing between your network virtual appliance (NVA) and your virtual network. It allows you to exchange routing information directly through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol between any NVA that supports the BGP routing protocol and the Azure Software Defined Network (SDN) in the Azure Virtual Network (VNet) without the need to manually configure or maintain route tables.

### Application protection services <a href="#protect" id="protect"></a>

This section describes networking services in Azure that help protect your network resources - Protect your applications using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - DDoS protection, Private Link, Firewall, Web Application Firewall, Network Security Groups, and Virtual Network Service Endpoints.

#### DDoS Protection <a href="#ddosprotection" id="ddosprotection"></a>

[Azure DDoS Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/manage-ddos-protection) provides countermeasures against the most sophisticated DDoS threats. The service provides enhanced DDoS mitigation capabilities for your application and resources deployed in your virtual networks. Additionally, customers using Azure DDoS Protection have access to DDoS Rapid Response support to engage DDoS experts during an active attack.

Azure DDoS Protection consists of two tiers:

* [DDoS Network Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview#ddos-network-protection), combined with application design best practices, provides enhanced DDoS mitigation features to defend against DDoS attacks. It's automatically tuned to help protect your specific Azure resources in a virtual network.
* [DDoS IP Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview#ddos-ip-protection) is a pay-per-protected IP model. DDoS IP Protection contains the same core engineering features as DDoS Network Protection, but will differ in the following value-added services: DDoS rapid response support, cost protection, and discounts on WAF.

## Azure Private Link

Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels through the Microsoft backbone network. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. You can create your own private link service in your virtual network and deliver it to your customers.\

## Azure Firewall <a href="#firewall" id="firewall"></a>

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. Using Azure Firewall, you can centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources allowing outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Web Application Firewall <a href="#waf" id="waf"></a>

Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides protection to your web applications from common web exploits and vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, and cross site scripting. Azure WAF provides out of box protection from OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities via managed rules.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Network security groups

Azure network security group to filter network traffic between Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

### Security rules <a href="#security-rules" id="security-rules"></a>

A network security group contains as many rules as desired, within Azure subscription [limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits). Each rule specifies the following properties:

| Property              | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Name                  | A unique name within the network security group. The name can be up to 80 characters long. It must begin with a word character, and it must end with a word character or with '\_'. The name may contain word characters or '.', '-', '\_'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Priority              | <p>A number between 100 and 4096. Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers, because lower numbers have higher priority. Once traffic matches a rule, processing stops. As a result, any rules that exist with lower priorities (higher numbers) that have the same attributes as rules with higher priorities aren't processed.<br><strong>Azure default security rules are given the highest number with the lowest priority to ensure that custom rules are always processed first.</strong></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Source or destination | Any, or an individual IP address, classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) block (10.0.0.0/24, for example), service tag, or application security group. If you specify an address for an Azure resource, specify the private IP address assigned to the resource. Network security groups are processed after Azure translates a public IP address to a private IP address for inbound traffic, and before Azure translates a private IP address to a public IP address for outbound traffic. Fewer security rules are needed when you specify a range, a service tag, or application security group. The ability to specify multiple individual IP addresses and ranges (you can't specify multiple service tags or application groups) in a rule is referred to as [augmented security rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview#augmented-security-rules). Augmented security rules can only be created in network security groups created through the Resource Manager deployment model. You can't specify multiple IP addresses and IP address ranges in network security groups created through the classic deployment model. |

| Port range            | You can specify an individual or range of ports. For example, you could specify 80 or 10000-10005. Specifying ranges enables you to create fewer security rules. Augmented security rules can only be created in network security groups created through the Resource Manager deployment model. You can't specify multiple ports or port ranges in the same security rule in network security groups created through the classic deployment model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Service endpoints

Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your VNet to the Azure services, over a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your VNet to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.
