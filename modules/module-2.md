## Azure Fundamentals

Azure is a public cloud provider, but it also offers private, hybrid, and multi-cloud solutions to users. Cloud services in Azure are designed to help users build innovative cloud solutions that help solve our challenges.

It allows us to build, develop, manage, and run resources like servers, databases, storage, or applications in multiple cloud environments. You can use it for different use cases in the cloud using the tools, programming languages, and frameworks that you prefer to use.

Azure offers over 200 services (as of time of writing) in various categories, including computing, networking, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning and AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud-native, containers, and security. However, Microsoft continues to introduce new features and services to Azure regularly, so the number of services may increase over time.

## Benefits of a Cloud Provider



| Benefits              | Descriptions                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High availability     | Microsoft Azure provides high availability and redundancy across all of its worldwide data canters offering a service-level agreement that ensures 99.99% availability.                   |
| Geo-distribution      | Azure helps global enterprises by providing geo-distribution features. Geography-specific endpoints enables international enterprises to comply with regional compliance and regulations. |
| Scalability on-demand | When demand for complexity, traffic, and data expands, there is a flexible and quick way to handle such needs                                                                             |
| Reliability           | The system or application hosted functions correctly even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human error)                                                    |
| Elasticity            | A capability to automatically scale cloud resources based on configuration or demand.                                                                                                     |
| Disaster recovery     | When your applications, data, and systems are hosted in Azure, you can be assured of secured end-to-end backup and disaster recovery solutions.                                           |
| Cost management tools | Tools available for cost management in Azure allow users to set budget alerts for their resource groups and resources.                                                                    |
| OpEx vs. CapEx        | Hosting to cloud means an organization can save money from capital expenditures (CapEx) and only pay for operational expenditures (OpEx).                                                 |

## Azure Portal&#x20;

The self-managed portal of Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform is called the _Azure Portal_; it can be accessed by Azure users on their web browsers or via the _Azure mobile app_. It is a web-based administration website for all types of Azure users, where you can manage the Azure cloud services for your organization. It is a powerful portal of cloud administration tools and resources.

## Compute Services in Azure&#x20;

Compute is the term used for computing resources. Compute services hosted in Azure provide computing resources like operating systems, networking, disks, processors, and memory. These compute resources are available quickly and on-demand for users. Every application is unique. An application can have many workloads that need more than one compute service.

&#x20;Resource Management Concepts in Microsoft Azure\
\
Azure Management Groups
-----------------------

Azure management groups are the top level of the core structure for managing your cloud resources in Azure. The management groups are where Azure administrators manage everything about user access, compliance, and policies for subscriptions. The subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the settings, conditions, and restrictions added in the group.

Azure role-based access control (RBAC) for all resources and role definitions is supported in the root management groups.

## Azure Subscriptions

Subscriptions in Azure are like a big container for all user accounts and resources they have accessed or used within the subscription. Every subscription has a limit of resources that a certain user can create and use. As an organization, you can use subscriptions to control the monthly bill and resource costs in your organization or your own Azure account. Using Azure subscriptions, the organization can also control what resources the users create, update, or delete.

## Azure Resource Groups

Azure users can group their services or resources using Azure resource groups. A resource group in Microsoft Azure acts as a logical container where resources like servers, web applications, databases, storage, monitoring, etc., are deployed, managed, and stored. Do not confuse a resource group with an availability set in Azure. The availability set is the logical group for virtual machines (VMs).

## Azure Resources

The databases, servers, virtual machines, or web applications you create on the Azure platform are considered Azure resources. All resources or services you create must be added to a resource group. which acts as the logical container. In a resource group, you can have web apps, servers, monitoring, compute services, etc., in one place.

## Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is also an important element in managing resources in Azure. ARM is the management and deployment service that provides users the capability to add, edit, and delete resources in Azure. By using ARM, the organization can manage user access control and organize resources securely even after deployment.

ARM templates are commonly used to automate deployments and to implement infrastructure as code (IaC). Azure provides native support for IaC using the ARM templates and also Azure Bicep in the Azure Resource Manager.

Terraform is also supported on Azure. IaC creates a great advantage, and it enables deployment automation of the infrastructure in the cloud. Using infrastructure as code, you can automate your deployment by generating templates for the same environment every time. The IaC process minimizes the problems of environment drift during development releases.

## Azure Geographies

Microsoft Azure has secured physical data centers worldwide in 140 countries. The global infrastructure of Azure, which also includes the infrastructure of Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform, is important in providing reliable, secure, and innovative smart cloud solutions.

## Azure Regions

Azure regions play a vital role in cloud computing for adaptability because each country or region has unique restrictions, policies, compliance, and rules.\

## Azure Availability Zones

An availability zone is composed of one or multiple data centers with independent facilities for power, networking, cooling, and support. The purpose of this isolation is to make sure that in case one of the zones stops working properly, the other zone continues to operate. These availability zones are connected and equipped with secure high-speed networks, which is important in running mission-critical resources for your computing, networking, storage, and data.
